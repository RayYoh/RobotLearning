# Materaials of Robot Learning

:loudspeaker: This is a repository contained some materials of Robot Learning(Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning). 

:beer: I also started a Zhihu Column in order to record my notes during the learning process. You can click [here](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1400541332461391872) to the column.

:pray: If you think it is usefull, please **star** it!

:raising_hand: If you have better material on hand, please fork it and submit your material in the repository.

## My suggestions

As we all konwn, when entering a new field, you may be confused as to where to start, especially in robot learning.
 
To help those who are new get into this field, I list the resources I am using (Listed in study order):
 
1. First of all, you are suppoesed to master some basic knowledge of **Deep Learning (DL)**.
   
   I recommend two courses:  
    * [Andrew Ng](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV164411b7dx?from=search&seid=3367987119980368879)(Perhaps most people choose it.)
    * [Hung-Yi Lee](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JK4y1D7Wb)(It's really interesting, but be careful not to be carried away by the accent.)
 
2. Next, you should master a **DL framework**, e.g. PyTorch or Tensorflow. I'm learning the PyTorch framework, but most of the RL algorithms are based on Tensorflow.

   However, I believe they will add a PyTorch version in the near future.

   Simple PyTorch tutorials that I recommend are:

    * [PyTorch](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Rv411y7oE)
