# Materaials of Robot Learning

:loudspeaker: This is a repository contained some materials of Robot Learning(Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning). 

:beer: I also started a Zhihu Column in order to record my notes during the learning process. You can click [here](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1400541332461391872) to the column.

:pray: If you think it is usefull, please **star** it!

:raising_hand: If you have better materials on hand, please **fork** it and submit your materials in the repository.

## My suggestions

As we all konwn, when entering a new field, you may be confused as to where to start, especially in robot learning.
 
To help those who are new get into this field, I list the resources I am using (Listed in study order):
 
1. First of all, you are suppoesed to master some basic knowledge of ***Deep Learning (DL)***.
   
   I recommend two courses:  
    * [Andrew Ng](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV164411b7dx?from=search&seid=3367987119980368879)(Perhaps most people choose it.)
    * [Hung-Yi Lee](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JK4y1D7Wb)(It's really interesting, but be careful not to be carried away by the accent.)
 
2. Next, you should master a ***DL framework***, e.g. PyTorch or Tensorflow. I'm learning the PyTorch framework, but most of the RL algorithms are based on Tensorflow.

   However, I believe they will add a PyTorch version in the near future.

   Simple PyTorch tutorials that I recommend are:
    * [Morvan](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Vx411j7kT)
    * [PyTorch](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Rv411y7oE)
    * [PyTorch Official Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)

3. Learn basic ***Robot Learning algorithms***.

5. ***Read the relevant papers in detail to master the specific algorithms.***

    You are suppossed to choose your research direction and read relevant papers. You should learn how other researchers have done experiments using related algorithms.
    
6. Last but not list, you should learn how to use the ***environments and simulators***, e.g. OpenAI Gym, ROS, MoJoCo etc. Click [here](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_39816905/article/details/118415701) for more details.
